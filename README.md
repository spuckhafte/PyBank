# PyBank
1. Object Oriented
2. Features like: Deposit, Transfer Money, Shows you a notification popup if any activity takes place
3. Excel-sheet is used as database

**IMPORTANT: Do not open the excel sheet while running the program, it won't work!**
<br><br>
*I think this is 'my' best Python program ever, and it reflects all the knowledge I have of this language*

# Bug Fixes and Updates
1. 'Seen' notification was popping when the user returned to home screen after doing other activities.
2. Now popups are collected and shown as whole if not checked. <br> ***Before**: `(1 new)`, if another activty was done without checking it, previous activity was ignored for the popup and still popup used to be`(1 new)` - for the latest log.*<br>***After**: (1 new), new activity is done without checking this log, popup: `(2 new)` - considering previous log.*
